## Pipe Operations

### Place

Place a 2D shape stored in a variable into the pipeline. Like `diff`/`union`/`inter`, it accepts variable references or inline 2D primitives as arguments.

```
| place $shape                # place a 2D shape from a variable
| place (circle 3)            # inline 2D primitive
```

After selecting a face, you can place a predefined profile for cutting or extruding. Useful when reusing the same shape multiple times.

```
$s = sketch [(5,0), arc (5,0) (0,-5) (-5,0), (0,7), (5,0)]
box 10 10 10 | faces >Z | place $s | cut
box 10 10 10 | faces >Z | place $s | extrude 5

$profile = rect 5 5
box 10 10 10 | faces >Z | place $profile | cut

box 10 10 10 | faces >Z | place (circle 3) | cut
```
