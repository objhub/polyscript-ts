## Primitives

### Position Convention

3D primitives and `extrude` follow different placement rules along the Z axis. Mixing them without care is a classic source of misalignment.

| Operation | Z-axis placement | Example (height 10) |
|---|---|---|
| `box`, `cylinder`, `sphere`, `cone`, `torus` | Centered at origin | z = -5..+5 |
| `extrude h` | Bottom-aligned (z=0 upward) | z = 0..10 |

In other words, the bottom face of `box 10 10 10` sits at z=-5, while `rect 10 10 | extrude 10` starts at z=0. When you put both in the same scene, their bottoms don't line up.

**Three ways to fix this:**

1. **`| floor`** -- Snap the bottom to z=0 (the easiest)
2. **`center:(true,true,false)`** -- Disable centering on the Z axis only
3. **`| translate 0 0 h/2`** -- Manually shift upward

```
# WRONG: want to stack a lid (extrude) on a body (box), but bottoms mismatch
$body = box 80 60 100             # z = -50..+50
$lid  = rect 80 60 | extrude 20  # z = 0..20
# $lid floats near the middle of the body

# RIGHT: use floor to align the body, then stack
$body = box 80 60 100 | floor               # z = 0..100
$lid  = rect 80 60 | extrude 20            # z = 0..20
$body | union ($lid | translate 0 0 100)    # lid on top
```
