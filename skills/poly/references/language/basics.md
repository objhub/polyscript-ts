## Overview

PolyScript is a pipe-based language for parametric CAD modeling. Shapes are created with primitives and transformed through a chain of pipe operations.

```
box 80 60 10 | fillet 2 | diff cylinder 10 10
```

When you write multiple shapes on separate lines, they are automatically combined (unioned) into a single shape.

```
box 10 10 10
sphere 8
# → the two shapes are automatically unioned
```

To combine shapes explicitly, use `union [...]`.

## Variables

The `$` prefix on variable names is optional. Both `$w = 80` and `w = 80` work. Reserved words (`box`, `cylinder`, `if`, `for`, etc.) cannot be used as variable names.

```
w = 80
h = 60
box w h 10

# $-prefixed form also works (backward compatible)
$w = 80
box $w $h 10
```

## Functions

Single-expression functions with `def`:

```
def standoff($r, $h, $hole_r) = cylinder $r $h | diff cylinder $hole_r $h

box 80 60 3
 | union standoff 4 10 1.5 at:10 10
```

## Import

Load function definitions from another `.poly` file:

```
import "gear"

spur_gear 12 2 | extrude 8
```

Imports are resolved relative to the importing file's directory.
