/**
 * Structured diagnostics — the machine-readable channel for everything that

 * Every diagnostic carries a **stable code**, so a caller can key off it
 * instead of matching prose: docs anchor on it, `poly explain <code>` prints
 * the long form, and an agent driving the CLI can look up the fix without
 * re-reading a reference file. The prose in `message` may be reworded at any
 * time; the code may not.
 *
 * This module is also the process-wide sink for kernel-level warnings. The
 * selector engine has no channel back to the CLI (Python uses the stdlib
 * `warnings` module for the same purpose); the CLI drains the sink after a run
 * and turns entries into report diagnostics, and into failures under --strict.
