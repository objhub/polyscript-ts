/**
 * A short digest of the built shape — "did my edit change the geometry?"
 *
 * Editing a model is otherwise blind: renaming a variable, extracting a
 * `@param`, reordering two independent branches are all meant to leave the
 * shape untouched, and nothing in a build report says whether they did. The
 * fingerprint makes that one comparison, and `poly diff` shows what moved when
 * it changed.
 *
 * It is a digest of the B-Rep facts, not of the exported mesh: same volume,
 * area, bounding box, solid count and topology counts means the same
 * fingerprint. What it cannot see: a shape that changed while keeping every one
 * of those figures (a rotation by 90 degrees about its own axis of symmetry,
 * two features swapping places). Treat a changed fingerprint as proof of a
 * change and an unchanged one as strong evidence of none.
 *
 * Figures are rounded to FINGERPRINT_PRECISION significant digits before
 * hashing. Below that, OCCT's own numbers move between kernel patch versions
 * and CPU architectures (devel/lang-vision202609.md section 7), which would
 * turn the digest into noise.
