/**
 * Build and export models in a browser.

 * Two engines behind one interface: PolyScript through the OCCT kernel, and

 * a host can offer either without knowing which it has.
 *
 * OpenSCAD is not bundled. It is GPL and nine megabytes; a host that wants it
 * passes the URL of its own copy (see ScadOptions), and a host that only
 * builds PolyScript pays nothing for it.
